# CloudSentinel - An Intelligent Vulnerability Detection Across Cloud Platforms

Cloud Sentinel is a security tool I’m building to work across both AWS and Azure. Its main goal is to detect common vulnerabilities and misconfigurations that could expose data or weaken security. Instead of focusing on just one cloud, it checks both platforms, giving a clear and simple report of what’s safe and what needs fixing. This way, users can protect their cloud systems more easily without getting lost in complex tools.
